You're only young for so long and these schools are so insane that it's really not worth killing yourself for what should be an amazing 4 years. I loved basically every moment of high school. Kids who didn't but looked the same on paper (or better) got rejected. Maybe it was URM that made the difference, but I like to think that if you are passionate and happy about life, thats way more important and comes through. Plus, then even if you do get rejected, you wont care. I checked cc for these a few times to see if I had a real chance after a subpar SAT performance &amp; I believe you should check to see if you're in the ballpark, but seriously, get off the computer and into the world once that's done.

Thus, I took the entire admissions process as a source of inspiration for myself, and only myself. My essays mirror that of a senior thesis of any college student, and they weren't written with the intention of impressing the admissions officers (bragging is quite useless and unnecessary), but rather with the genuine desire to cohesively put together the snippets of my own story. And I think that, if an institution is compelled and intrigued with your story, it'll check its acceptance marks. If not, then there isn't a compatibility, and that's totally okay.

I might have not got in because of factor I could control lk my essays or because of uncontrollable factor like other applicant who are passionate about healthcare reform and developing countries. you never really know but you can always try to make sure your controllable factors are perfect and then ensure your personality can be seen if you print out your whole application material and read it.

Also make sure their is one match school that is almost like your dream school make yourself fall in live with it so that when or if you get rejected form your dream reach it's just like \"oh well that's one less thing to think about\" instead of \"oh no what will I occupy my life with now.\" PM if u hav any questions",

I started to wake up and realize that I didn't want to go to my state school (no offense ASU!) and end up with a desk job, working 9 to 5 and not accomplishing more. I was entitled - I thought I was such a smart kid, and that I was destined to rule the world, cure cancer, marry Emma Watson. So I involved myself in a bunch of clubs that I didn't care about, started studying for tests that I hated studying for, all in an attempt to pad my application. In my senior year, I took a look at myself and I didn't know who I was. I was a phony, a hack, who did what he had to do to get to a place that he thought he had to get to. I embraced my quirks and my love for music during this past year, but I regret that it was too late. When I look back on my high school life, I realize that I wasted my time doing things that I didn't like doing. I can't think of more than 5 memorable experiences I had in my high school years. I just wish I had accepted myself earlier. Then I could say, \"Oh I don't regret high school. I had a ton of fun!\"",

I very nearly applied Dartmouth ED, but realized that even if I got in and I would always wonder what could have been had I applied to Harvard. Basically, don\u2019t try to game the ED process, apply to the school that is your true #1. Also: do not obsess over test scores or academics in general. I realize this may sound hypocritical coming from me, but I don\u2019t think my stats had much to do with me getting in. Your grades and test scores really just do need to be \u201cgood enough\u201d to convince admissions you would be able to be successful academically at Harvard.

So much comes down to luck that you should not apply early unless it is your top choice. My family has tons of legacy at another good school and I was pressured to apply there early \"in order to maximize my chances.\" But I knew that I did not want to commit to a school without giving my best shot at HYP. If you have worked so hard for four years, you should at least try! DO NOT live with regret. There are so many schools you can apply to regular, why throw it all away applying early somewhere else without giving a school like Harvard a shot first?",

I may be at the top of the academic ladder in my public school and geographical region, but didn't think I'd have a chance competing against the world. I'm middle class, very white, and not the best test-taker there is. However, I've sought knowledge no matter what, pursued my passions for international relations and neuroscience, and have just done what I love to do. I have a deep belief in the transparency of motives: if you fake your way through life, just aiming for top marks but not enjoying anything along the way, you are not fooling anyone. Admissions officers especially are able to see past such facades. But even doing what you love only raises your chances at such schools slightly. Just remember that many passionate and smart students are declined or accepted for the most miniscule of reasons.",

However, my friend got into an accident today; he's fine; and that got me thinking. You can't control what's going to happen in the world around you. You simply have to try your hardest to make things happen and hope for the best. The decision you received from, let me remind you, one of the most difficult academic institutions to gain entrance into, is in many cases not a good judgement of your worth. Almost all of you on this thread are spectacular individuals and you would all thrive at any school regardless of whether it's Harvard or not. To those deferred, best of luck on regular decisions.

As for deferred and denied students--just remember everyone that you are more than just one decision, and that one decision doesn't define you.

One of my favorite quotes is \"everything will turn out alright in the end, and if it is not alright, then it is not yet the end,\" from \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" movie, and I find it comforting to keep in mind during this whole process.

I wanted to figure out how to get into Harvard and while I did get in, I don't think there is any formulaic approach. To those seeking admission to Harvard, the best advice I can give you is to get good grades, pursue one extracurricular in depth, be well-rounded, talk about your passion in your essays, and sell yourself! Be busy during your summers, but still live a balanced lifestyle and have fun. I had a great four years, and also really get to know your teachers and establish good relations with them!",
